George Wallace was a prominent political figure in the 1960s, known for his staunch support of racial segregation. Serving as Governor of Alabama, Wallace became famous for his pro-segregation stance, epitomized by his 1963 inaugural speech where he declared, "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever." He also attempted to physically block the integration of the University of Alabama, which was a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.
