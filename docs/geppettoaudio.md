# Comprehensive Technical Document for `mainaudio.go`

## Overview

The `mainaudio.go` file is part of the Geppeto Audio System, which acts as a WebSocket-based real-time audio and text communication application, integrated with OpenAI's APIs. This document provides an overview of the components, their interactions, and the flow of operations in `mainaudio.go`. The code focuses on handling bi-directional communication, audio chunking, and real-time processing, utilizing the `gorilla/websocket` library.

The application interfaces with OpenAI's Realtime API, which is in beta. This API allows for low-latency, multi-modal conversational experiences, supporting text and audio both as input and output. Notable features of the Realtime API include native speech-to-speech capabilities, natural and steerable voices, and simultaneous multimodal output. However, given its beta status, there are considerations for secure server-side authentication and challenges in managing network reliability. 

## Structure and Main Components

The `mainaudio.go` script is designed for real-time communication and contains the following primary sections:

1. **Imports**: It uses various Go packages to facilitate WebSocket connections, logging, encoding, audio handling, and other utility functions.
2. **Core Types**: Two custom wrapper types, `ChatClient` and `Logger`, extend functionalities of pre-existing types defined in the `audiotypes` package.
3. **Configurations and Constants**: Contains the `DefaultConfig()` function which provides default configurations for timeouts, retries, and output directories.
4. **Transcript Management**: A function to manage saving of transcripts, ensuring logging and proper verification.
5. **WebSocket Management**: Establishes the connection to OpenAI's WebSocket API, sends session updates, and handles the client lifecycle.
6. **Concurrency and Goroutines**: Utilizes goroutines to handle concurrent tasks such as message processing, audio chunking, and graceful shutdowns.
7. **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles signal interruptions and ensures a clean shutdown sequence.

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Imports

The file imports several Go standard library packages and third-party modules:

- **Standard Libraries**: Packages like `context`, `fmt`, `log`, `os`, `sync`, and `time` provide utilities for input/output, concurrency, logging, and synchronization.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: The script utilizes the `github.com/gorilla/websocket` library for managing WebSocket connections and `geppetoaudio/audiotypes` for custom type definitions.

### 2. Core Types and Structures

- **`ChatClient` and `Logger`**: These types are wrappers over the core structures defined in `audiotypes`, providing additional functionalities required for handling audio and chat sessions.

```go
// Local wrapper types
type ChatClient struct {
    *audiotypes.ChatClient
}

type Logger struct {
    *audiotypes.Logger
}
```

The wrappers extend `audiotypes.ChatClient` and `audiotypes.Logger`, effectively adding local behaviors and logging specific to this application.

### 3. Configurations: `DefaultConfig()`

The `DefaultConfig()` function initializes the configurations required for the client:

- **ReadTimeout (time.Duration)**: Defines the maximum wait time for a read operation.
- **WriteTimeout (time.Duration)**: Defines the timeout for a write operation.
- **PingInterval (time.Duration)**: Periodic ping messages sent to ensure the WebSocket connection stays alive.
- **MaxRetries (int)**: Maximum number of connection retries allowed.
- **BufferSize (int)**: Defines the size of the data buffer.
- **ShutdownTimeout (time.Duration)**: Duration allowed for graceful shutdown.
- **AudioOutputDir (string)**: Directory path for storing audio output files.

This function returns a `ClientConfig` object which is essential for managing client settings.

```go
func DefaultConfig() audiotypes.ClientConfig {
    return audiotypes.ClientConfig{
        ReadTimeout:     30 * time.Second,
        WriteTimeout:    10 * time.Second,
        PingInterval:    30 * time.Second,
        MaxRetries:      3,
        BufferSize:      100,
        ShutdownTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        AudioOutputDir:  "audio_output",
    }
}
```

### 4. Transcript Handling: `saveTranscript()`

This function is responsible for saving the transcript to a `.txt` file. It ensures that the transcript file is properly formatted and saved with metadata like the generation timestamp.

- **File Naming**: The transcript file has the same name as the corresponding `.wav` audio file, with `.txt` as the extension.
- **Logging**: There are warnings for empty transcripts, verification of the file writing process, and detailed logging of the saved file content length.

```go
func (c *ChatClient) saveTranscript(filepath string, transcript string) error {
    if transcript == "" {
        log.Printf("Warning: Empty transcript received")
        transcript = "No transcript available"
    }

    textPath := strings.TrimSuffix(filepath, ".wav") + ".txt"
    timestamp := time.Now().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05")
    formattedTranscript := fmt.Sprintf("Generated: %s\nAudio File: %s\nTranscript:\n%s\n",
        timestamp,
        filepath,
        transcript)

    log.Printf("Writing transcript to file: %s\nContent length: %d bytes",
        textPath,
        len(formattedTranscript))

    if err := os.WriteFile(textPath, []byte(formattedTranscript), 0644); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("write transcript file: %w", err)
    }

    if info, err := os.Stat(textPath); err != nil {
        log.Printf("Error verifying transcript file: %v", err)
    } else {
        log.Printf("Transcript file written successfully, size: %d bytes", info.Size())
    }

    return nil
}
```

### 5. WebSocket Initialization and Session Management

The `main()` function is the entry point of the application. It establishes a WebSocket connection to OpenAI's real-time API, using an API key that must be provided through an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).

- **Headers and Dialer**: The WebSocket dialer sets up authorization headers and makes the connection request.
- **Session Update**: A structured session update (`session.update`) is sent, specifying the modalities (`text`, `audio`), temperature, max response tokens, and personality settings.

```go
func main() {
    apiKey := os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    if apiKey == "" {
        log.Fatal("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set")
    }

    config := DefaultConfig()

    header := make(map[string][]string)
    header["Authorization"] = []string{"Bearer " + apiKey}
    header["OpenAI-Beta"] = []string{"realtime=v1"}

    dialer := websocket.Dialer{
        HandshakeTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
    }

    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    url := "wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01"
    conn, _, err := dialer.DialContext(ctx, url, header)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("dial:", err)
    }

    client, err := NewChatClient(conn, config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal("create chat client:", err)
    }

    sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(sigChan, os.Interrupt)
    go func() {
        <-sigChan
        fmt.Println("\nReceived interrupt signal. Shutting down...")
        client.shutdown()
    }()

    sessionUpdate := audiotypes.SessionUpdate{
        Type: "session.update",
        Session: audiotypes.Session{
            Modalities:              []string{"text", "audio"},
            Temperature:             0.8,
            MaxResponseOutputTokens: 4096,
            Voice:                   "alloy",
            InputAudioFormat:        "pcm16",
            OutputAudioFormat:       "pcm16",
            Instructions: "System settings:\nInstructions:\n" +
                "- You are an artificial intelligence agent\n" +
                "- Be kind, helpful, and courteous\n" +
                "- It is okay to ask the user questions\n" +
                "- Be open to exploration and conversation\n" +
                "- Remember: this is just for fun and testing!\n\n" +
                "Personality:\n" +
                "- Be upbeat and genuine\n" +
                "- Try to be informative and engaging\n" +
                "- Use a natural, conversational tone\n",
        },
    }

    if err := client.Start(sessionUpdate); err != nil {
        log.Fatal("client start:", err)
    }
}
```

### 6. Concurrency and Goroutines

The `mainaudio.go` script makes extensive use of Go's goroutines to ensure the system remains responsive and can handle multiple tasks concurrently. Below is an explanation of how goroutines are used:

- **WebSocket Message Handling**: When the WebSocket connection is established, a dedicated goroutine is started to listen for incoming messages from the server. This prevents blocking other operations and allows the client to continue sending messages concurrently.

```go
go func() {
    for {
        _, message, err := client.Conn.ReadMessage()
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("Error reading message: %v", err)
            break
        }
        // Handle incoming message
        client.MessageChannel <- string(message)
    }
}()
```

- **Signal Handling for Graceful Shutdown**: A goroutine is used to handle incoming OS signals, such as interrupts, allowing the application to perform cleanup operations before shutting down.

```go
go func() {
    <-sigChan
    fmt.Println("\nReceived interrupt signal. Shutting down...")
    client.shutdown()
}()
```

- **Concurrent Audio Chunk Processing**: Audio data received from the server is processed in chunks, each handled in a separate goroutine to maintain real-time processing without blocking the reception of subsequent audio chunks.

```go
go func(audioChunk AudioChunk) {
    // Process audio chunk concurrently
    processAudioChunk(audioChunk)
}(chunk)
```

- **Worker Pool for Audio and Text Synchronization**: A pool of goroutines is used to handle synchronization between text and audio data. This ensures that both modalities are processed concurrently and efficiently, maintaining a seamless user experience.

### 7. Graceful Shutdown Handling

A graceful shutdown mechanism is implemented to handle interruptions from the operating system. Upon receiving a termination signal (`SIGINT`), the client is gracefully closed to avoid leaving open connections.

- **Signal Handling**: Uses Go's `os/signal` package to listen for `SIGINT` signals and cleanly shut down the client.

```go
sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigChan, os.Interrupt)
go func() {
    <-sigChan
    fmt.Println("\nReceived interrupt signal. Shutting down...")
    client.shutdown()
}()
```

## Data Types Used

### 1. `ClientConfig`
The `ClientConfig` structure is used to manage the configuration settings for the client. It is defined as follows:

```go
type ClientConfig struct {
    ReadTimeout     time.Duration  // Maximum wait time for a read operation
    WriteTimeout    time.Duration  // Maximum wait time for a write operation
    PingInterval    time.Duration  // Interval between ping messages
    MaxRetries      int            // Maximum retry attempts for connection
    BufferSize      int            // Size of the data buffer
    ShutdownTimeout time.Duration  // Time allowed for a graceful shutdown
    AudioOutputDir  string         // Directory for audio output files
}
```

### 2. `AudioChunk`
`AudioChunk` is used to represent a segment of audio data being processed. Each chunk contains identifiers, sequence indexes, and the raw audio data.

```go
type AudioChunk struct {
    ResponseID   string  // Unique identifier for the response
    ItemID       string  // Unique item identifier
    OutputIndex  int     // Index for output sequence
    ContentIndex int     // Index for content sequence
    Data         []byte  // Raw audio data
}
```

### 3. `AudioMessage`
`AudioMessage` represents an audio message along with its transcript.

```go
type AudioMessage struct {
    Transcript string  // Text transcript of the audio
    AudioData  []byte  // Processed audio data
    Complete   bool    // Status indicating if the audio is fully processed
}
```

### 4. `SessionUpdate` and `Session`
These types are used for managing session-related information and updates. The `SessionUpdate` type contains session details such as modalities and settings.

```go
type SessionUpdate struct {
    Type    string  `json:"type"`
    Session Session `json:"session"`
}

type Session struct {
    Modalities              []string `json:"modalities"`
    Instructions            string   `json:"instructions"`
    Temperature             float64  `json:"temperature"`
    MaxResponseOutputTokens int      `json:"max_response_output_tokens"`
    Voice                   string   `json:"voice"`
    InputAudioFormat        string   `json:"input_audio_format"`
    OutputAudioFormat       string   `json:"output_audio_format"`
}
```

### 5. `Logger`
The `Logger` type is responsible for handling log file writing, ensuring thread-safe access to the log file.

```go
type Logger struct {
    File    *os.File
    Mu      sync.Mutex
    Encoder *json.Encoder
}
```

### 6. `ChatClient`
The `ChatClient` type encapsulates the WebSocket connection and manages communication channels, buffers, and logging.

```go
type ChatClient struct {
    Conn           *websocket.Conn
    MessageChannel chan string
    DisplayChannel chan ChatMessage
    AudioChannel   chan AudioChunk
    Done           chan struct{}
    ShutdownOnce   sync.Once
    WG             sync.WaitGroup
    Logger         *Logger
    Config         ClientConfig
    Metrics        *Metrics
    AudioBuffer    map[string]*AudioMessage
    AudioMutex     sync.Mutex
}
```
